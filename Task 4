I found it confusing when trying to create a circuit that does 2 actions at once. When I first started this assignment I thought we would be changing the current from one product to the other manually. Instead we were doing it with code by just starting one process and starting another. This is important because things that used to be hard to do manually are much easier now that we have a high level programming language that can be used by virtually anyone. This application could include anything from a stoplight at an intersection, all the way to lights turning off and on at night with a switch that controls if a microcontroller sends power to the unit. The possibilities are endless.
