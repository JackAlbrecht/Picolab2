Hi everyone!

This repository is for my Engineering 151 class where we are using pi picos to do some fun stuff! This is the second lab of the course, and includes 2.3, 2.8, 2.9 and lightshow, which are all python files. lightshow is coded to have a green led or a rbg led turn on based on what position our slide switch is in. 

2.3 is to demonstrate reading button values

2.8 is to demonstrate a fading LED

2.9 is to demonstrate an RGB LED

Task 2 & 4 are for Eric Davashal to grade my task responses.

Thanks!
