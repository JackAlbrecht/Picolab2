1. The function and purpose of the pull-up resistor is to negate any noisy signal that can trigger a false positive even when youâ€™re not pushing the button. 
The value of the button object is 1 when pressed because without pressing the button current cant flow from one side of the H to the other side of the H, 
meaning the value is 0 before the button is pushed.

2. PWM output basically means variable power output because it will change the speed of going on or off to create a higher or lower brightness due to 
the residual power left after turning off, and residual power left after turning on. Using PWM you can select any number between 0 and 2^16 to tell you 
the variable power to output to the selected pin using duty_u16. Python sends instructions to control the PWM signal parameters by freq which will change 
how fast the power is switched, and duty_u16 which will set the duty cycle which is a 16 bit integer meaning 2^16 as previously explained and this 16bit number 
will be 0-100%, 100% being full light at 2^16.

3. The value that interval_mapping would return for an input of 300 is roughly 76800 because it is mapping 2^8 to 2^16. This would affect the overall 
operation of the circuit because the duty cycle loops after 2^16 and resets at 0, therefore the light would be much more dim than expected.
